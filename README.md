# RPG-Inventory-Manager
Very basic version of a inventory manager software. New features and improvements will be implemented in the future.

# About
The whole software is being developed in Qt Creator in C++. That's why there are only .cpp, .h, and .ui files here. You can open the project by downloading Qt Creator, creating a new project, and copying every file to it.

# Install
Right now you need Qt Creator to run this software, since it hasn't been compiled yet (I will wait for a more complete version). In the near future I will release a stand-alone file to run it
